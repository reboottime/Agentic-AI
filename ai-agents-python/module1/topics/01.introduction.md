# Introduction to Agentic AI

## What is Agentic AI?

- AI that acts with agency and autonomy
- Can problem-solve and react to different situations
- Takes actions, sees results, and responds based on outcomes

## Key Characteristics

- **Adaptive**: Responds to unexpected situations (e.g., no vegetables → use durian fruit). Traditional computer system is rigit.
- **Interactive**: Works step-by-step with feedback loops
- **Autonomous**: Makes choices about what to do and when
- **Flexible**: Not rigid like traditional computer systems

## Human-in-the-Loop Pattern

- Agent gives instructions
- Human performs actions
- Human provides feedback
- Agent adapts and gives next instruction

## Example: Cooking Agent

### Initial Prompt

```md
You're going to help me cook whatever I need. Since you can't directly lift pots or pans or get to the fridge, you will tell me the steps and I will perform them. We will go one step at a time, ask me for what I want to cook.
```

### Process Flow

1. Agent specifies cooking tasks
2. Human executes tasks
3. Human reports results
4. Agent adapts plan based on feedback

### Demonstration

- **Request**: "I'd like to cook a dish that combines the flavors of Ethiopia, Uzbekistan, while being keto friendly and under 1000 calories"
- **Agent Response**: Creates plan with ingredients and step-by-step instructions
- **Adaptation Example**: When meat starts burning → Agent provides immediate solution (reduce heat, add water/broth)

## Key Challenges

- **Interface Gap**: Bridging fluid AI communication with rigid computer systems
- **Error Tolerance**: Humans adapt to varied AI output formats; computers don't
- **Prompt Engineering**: Making AI work with existing tools and systems

## Core Principle

Agent specifies what it wants done → External system (human/computer) carries it out → Agent receives feedback and adapts
