# Running the Code Samples in the Course

Running the Code Samples in the Course
Thoughout the course, we will be using
LiteLLM
, a library that provides a unified interface for interacting with over 100 different LLMs including GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, and many others. By using a single interface, we can easily switch between different models without changing our code, making it perfect for testing different LLMs or having fallback options in production. This will also allow us to make our agent reusable across LLMs — although we may need to do some prompt engineering to make it work with a new LLM.

WE STRONGLY RECOMMEND USING GOOGLE COLAB WITH AN OPENAI API KEY FOR RUNNING THE CODE IN THIS COURSE.

## API Key

You will need API keys for the LLM providers you plan to use. All of the examples in this course were written and tested for OpenAI’s GPT-4o or GPT-4o-mini model. You are welcome to use another LLM, but you will need to figure out how to configure LiteLLM for that LLM. Usually, this is pretty easy and we provide a prompt that you can use in ChatGPT to get help.

You can read about how to get an OpenAI API key here:
Open AI API Keys
. You can also use Anthropic’s Claude, Google Gemini, Meta’s LLama, or any other model that LiteLLM supports. However, we will only provide the configuration for using OpenAI in the tutorials.

### Stop and Get an API Key

Once you have your API key, continue. Again, we recommend using
Open AI API Keys
.

If your aren’t using OpenAI…
If you decided NOT to use OpenAI, you will have to adapt the code samples in each lesson. Usually, this is as easy as changing this block of code at the top of each example:

For example, to change to Anthropic, you would change this:

```python
# Important!!!
#
# <---- Set your 'OPENAI_API_KEY' as a secret over there with the "key" icon
#
#
import os
from google.colab import userdata
api_key = userdata.get('OPENAI_API_KEY')
os.environ['OPENAI_API_KEY'] = api_key

```

to this

```python
# Based on https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/providers/anthropic
#
# Important!!!
#
# <---- Set your 'ANTHROPIC_API_KEY' as a secret in Google Colab the "key" icon
#
#
import os
from google.colab import userdata
api_key = userdata.get('ANTHROPIC_API_KEY')
os.environ['ANTHROPIC_API_KEY'] = api_key

```

Read the LiteLLM documentation if you need to use another provider:
Lite LLM Provider Configuration

If are not using OpenAI and are still running into issues…
You can use the following prompt in ChatGPT to help you adapt the code to work with another LLM:

Please ask me for my code and the LLM provider (e.g., Anthropic, OpenAI, etc.) that I am using. Then, rewrite the code to show me how to configure it using an API key for that provider. Only adapt the bare minimum of items in the configuration. Do not change the code that interacts with the LLM if possible. I want to use LiteLLM <https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/providers>.

Note: Many of the examples will only work with an LLM that supports function calling.

You will need to provide the API key as an environment variable to your code as described in the LiteLLM documentation sing
LiteLLM
. I strongly recommend that you do not hardcode your API keys in your code.

### Try Out Your API Key

Once you have an API key, you can use this Jupyter notebook on Google Colab to try out your key:
[Example Code in Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/10USwjwaJ-1J-I_2igKIbJ-GdMDWlHKRU?usp=sharing)

Most lessons will have a notebook AT THE END OF THE LESSON / MODULE that you can use to test the code.

## How to Run the Code in the Tutorials

### Using Google Colab (Recommended Method)

Google Colab provides the easiest way to run this agent code without setting up a local environment. Each lesson will have one or more Google Colab notebook links you can use to get started quickly.

### Using Jupyter Notebooks Locally

If you prefer to use Jupyter notebooks on your local machine:

Install Python: Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed on your system

Create a virtual environment (recommended):

Install dependencies:

Set up API keys as environment variables before starting Jupyter:

Start Jupyter:

Create a new notebook and paste the complete code in, preferably starting with the version stored in Google Colab.

### Running as a Python Script

To run the agent code as a standalone Python script:

Create a new Python file (e.g., agent.py) with the agent code. You can copy / paste the code from the Google Colab notebook into a file in the order that it appears. You want JUST the code.

Set environment variables before running the script:

Run the script:

Alternative: Use python-dotenv for easier API key management:

Troubleshooting Common Issues
API Key Errors: Ensure your API key is correctly set as an environment variable

Module Not Found: Verify that you’ve installed all required packages

Rate Limiting: If you encounter rate limits, add a short delay between API calls

Remember that Google Colab or Jupyter notebooks offer the most straightforward setup, especially for beginners or quick testing. They provide an interactive environment where you can execute code cells individually and see the results immediately.
