# Programmatic Prompting for Agents

## Sending Prompts Programmatically & Managing Memory

**Note:** A link to the complete code in a Google `Colab` notebook will be provided in the next item in the course. Read through this lesson and then click next to get the link to the code.

To get started building agents, we need to understand how to send prompts to LLMs. Agents require two key capabilities:

1. **Programmatic prompting** - Automating the prompt-response cycle that humans do manually in a conversation. This forms the foundation of the Agent Loop we'll explore.

2. **Memory management** - Controlling what information persists between iterations, like API calls and their results, to maintain context through the agent's decision-making process.

Programmatically sending prompts is how we move from having a human type in prompts and then take action based on the LLM's response to having an agent that can do this automatically. The Agent Loop that we will begin building over the next several readings will be programmatically sending prompts to the LLM and then taking action based on the LLM's response.

We will also need to understand how to manage what the LLM knows or remembers. This is important because we want to be able to control what information the LLM has in each iteration of the loop. For example, if it just called an API, we want it to remember what API it asked to be invoked and what the result of that action was.

## Basic Usage

Here's a simple example of how to send prompts to an LLM using LiteLLM:

```python
#
# Set your API key as shown in the Google Colab notebook
#
from litellm import completion
from typing import List, Dict

def generate_response(messages: List[Dict]) -> str:
    """Call LLM to get response"""
    response = completion(
        model="openai/gpt-4o",
        messages=messages,
        max_tokens=1024
    )
    return response.choices[0].message.content

messages = [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are an expert software engineer that prefers functional programming."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Write a function to swap the keys and values in a dictionary."}
]

response = generate_response(messages)
print(response)
```
