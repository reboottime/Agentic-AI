# Flipped Interaction Pattern

## What is Flipped Interaction Pattern?

- Foundation of agentic systems where AI tells us what to do instead of us telling it
- AI asks questions or tells existing computer systems to run actions
- Creates environment where AI is in the driver's seat

## Core Pattern Structure

> Ask me questions one at a time in order to get enough information to [GOAL]. Ask the first question.

## Key Components

- **One at a time**: Best practice for agentic systems
- **Goal-oriented**: Clear objective provided upfront
- **Start trigger**: "Ask the first question" or "Tell me the first step"

## Restaurant Example Demonstration

### Initial Prompt

> Ask me questions one at a time in order to gather enough information to suggest restaurants for me to eat at in Nashville, Tennessee, tonight. Ask the first question.

### Conversation Flow

1. **AI**: "What type of cuisine are you in the mood for tonight?"
2. **Human**: "Tex-Mex"
3. **AI**: "Do you have any dietary restrictions or preferences?"
4. **Human**: "No"
5. **AI**: "Do you prefer casual dining or something more upscale?"
6. **Human**: "Kid friendly"
7. **AI**: "Would you like outdoor or indoor seating?"
8. **Human**: "Doesn't matter, it's raining"
9. **AI**: "Specific area preference?"
10. **Human**: "Near Vanderbilt"
11. **AI**: "How far willing to travel?"
12. **Human**: "Short drive, 5-10 minutes"
13. **AI**: Recommends Rosepepper Cantina
14. **Human**: "Google says 13 minutes, feeling lazy"
15. **AI**: Adapts and suggests SATCo (across from Vanderbilt)

## Key Agentic Behaviors

- **Adaptive questioning**: Next question based on previous response
- **Format flexibility**: Handles varied human response formats
- **Real-time adaptation**: Adjusts recommendations based on feedback
- **Context awareness**: Incorporates all previous information

## AI as Protocol Droid

- Translates human goals into executable plans
- Speaks different "languages" (human, database, system interfaces)
- Acts as interface between humans and computer systems
- Excellent at translation between formats

## Difference from Traditional AI

- **Traditional**: Human directs every step
- **Agentic**: AI chooses steps, human performs, AI adapts based on results
- **Key**: AI gets feedback about step results and continuously adapts

## Pattern Benefits

- **Fluid interaction**: No rigid response formats required
- **Intelligent adaptation**: AI responds to unexpected inputs
- **Goal achievement**: Maintains focus on original objective
- **Multi-system interface**: Can communicate with various systems
