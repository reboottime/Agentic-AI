# The Agent Loop

## Core Concept

The agent loop transforms manual AI conversations into autonomous AI agents. It enables programmatic translation of human goals into computer actions.

## From Conversation to Agent

**Manual Conversation Example:**

- Human: "Help me cook this, tell me one step at a time"
- AI: "Go get these ingredients"
- Human: "I'm out of beans"
- AI: "Skip the beans and move on" (adaptation/agency)

**Agent Automation:**

- Human kicks off task: "Help me add this travel expense"
- Agent autonomously uses APIs/functions to complete task
- No human intervention required during execution

## Key Agent Characteristics

- **Agency**: Decides what actions to take
- **Adaptability**: Handles unexpected situations robustly
- **Translation**: Converts natural language goals into computation

## The Agent Loop Architecture

### Six Core Steps

1. **Construct Prompt** - Build guidance for the agent
2. **Send to LLM** - Get response from large language model
3. **Parse Response** - Extract actionable information in programmatic format
4. **Execute Action** - Perform API calls, file operations, etc.
5. **Get Feedback** - Collect results, errors, HTTP responses
6. **Decide Continue** - Determine if loop should continue, add feedback to next prompt

### Loop Flow

```
Task Input → Prompt → LLM Response → Parse Action → Execute → Get Feedback → Continue/Stop
```

## Example: Travel Expense Agent

1. **Task**: "Add travel expense"
2. **First Action**: List spreadsheet rows
3. **Feedback**: Existing rows data
4. **Next Action**: Check if expense exists
5. **Final Action**: Add new row if needed

## Critical Implementation Details

- **Prompt Construction**: Most important work - guides agent behavior
- **Response Parsing**: Must work with rigid software infrastructure
- **Feedback Integration**: Results added to prompt for next iteration
- **Prompt Growth**: Builds larger context over time through feedback accumulation

## Why This Architecture Works

- **Simplicity**: Basic loop handles most use cases
- **Autonomy**: Removes human from execution loop
- **Robustness**: Handles errors and adapts through feedback
- **Scalability**: Can be extended with additional capabilities

This fundamental architecture forms the foundation for building powerful AI agents that can autonomously complete complex tasks.
