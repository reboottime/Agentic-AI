# Module 1: AI Agent Concepts

## Progress

- [x] 01. Introduction
  - agentic system is more adaptable and interpretable to traditional computer system
  - the prompt: clearly dictated the goal and process clearly
    > You're going to help me cook whatever I need. Since you can't directly lift pots or pans or get to the fridge, you will tell me the steps and I will perform them. We will go one step at a time, ask me for what I want to cook.
