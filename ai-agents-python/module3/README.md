# Module 3: GAME Framework and Agent Design

## Progress

- [x] 01. Overview of the GAME Framework:
  - what is it ?: Goal, Action, Memory, Environment.
  - ![x](./topics/imgs/calendar-agent.png)
  - implementation tricks:
    - prototype the agent conversations quickly to identify
    - check [agent.py](./topics/code/angent.py) to view codebase concept design  in Python
- [x] 02. Designing AI Agents with GAME
  - Goal
    - objective - what
    - instructions - how
  - [x] why actions define what the agent can do? not what the agent is gonna todo?
    > For example, an agent might have an action called read_file(), which is simply a placeholder in the Actions layer. The Environment then provides the actual logic, handling file I/O operations and error handling to ensure the action is executed correctly.
