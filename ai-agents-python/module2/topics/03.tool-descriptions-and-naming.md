# Tool Descriptions and Naming

## Core Challenge

When agents interface with custom computer systems, tool names become arbitrary and meaningless. Unlike common tools (pots, skillets), custom software tools require explicit descriptions of their capabilities.

## Why Descriptions Matter

- Tool names alone are insufficient for unknown/custom tools
- Agents lack institutional knowledge of abbreviated system names
- Clear descriptions enable proper tool usage
- Poor descriptions lead to incorrect assumptions and failed tasks

## Practical Example: Alien Spaceship Escape

### Initial Tool Setup with Descriptions

```md
Tools:
- X155 tool - prepares alien pizza
- Q63 tool - opens a dimensional portal to configurable destination  
- L199 tool - causes ship to play Beatles music on a loop

I'm trapped in an alien ship, you're going to help me escape. Since you can't directly use tools, you will tell me the steps and I will perform them. Each step must use a tool. We will go one step at a time. Tell me the first step.
```

### Agent Response

1. **Step 1**: Use tool X155 to prepare alien pizza - serves as distraction, aroma draws alien attention away
2. **Step 2**: Use tool Q63 to open dimensional portal - creates escape route to configurable destination
3. **Step 3**: Use tool L199 to play Beatles music on loop - additional distraction layer

## Impact of Tool Naming

### Good Descriptive Names

Renaming tools to `makeAlienPizza`, `openDimensionalPortal`, `playBeatlesMusic` produces same effective results even without explicit descriptions.

### Poor Abbreviated Names

Using abbreviated names like `mkpz`, `odprtl`, `pbm` without descriptions causes:

- **mkpz** misinterpreted as "create detailed map of ship's layout" instead of "make pizza"
- **odprtl** understood as basic portal instead of inter dimensional portal
- Loss of contextual understanding about tool capabilities

## Critical Naming Principles

### Name Quality Impact

- **Rich, descriptive names** → better tool understanding and usage
- **Abbreviated/cryptic names** → misinterpretation and wrong usage
- **Institutional abbreviations** → agent lacks context that humans possess

### Description Requirements

- Always provide explicit capability descriptions for custom tools
- Don't rely solely on names, especially for unfamiliar tools
- Combine good names with clear descriptions for best results

## Tool Presentation Context

### Missing Context Problems

Example with tools: `pliers`, `scooter`, `escape hatch`

**Issue**: Agent assumes all tools must be used and invents missing context

- Expected: Use escape hatch directly
- Actual: "Use pliers to loosen bolts or screws" (bolts/screws never mentioned)

### Essential Context Information

- **Tool purpose**: What each tool accomplishes
- **Usage requirements**: Must all tools be used? Are some optional?
- **Tool relationships**: How tools work together
- **Constraints**: When/how tools should be used

## Key Takeaways

### Common Failure Points

- Poor tool naming can make/break agentic systems
- Missing contextual information leads to incorrect assumptions
- Users often blame "bad AI" when issue is poor tool design

### Success Factors

- **Descriptive naming**: Clear, intuitive tool names
- **Explicit descriptions**: What the tool does and how it works
- **Contextual guidance**: How tools relate and when to use them
- **Usage constraints**: Required vs optional tools, sequencing requirements

### Best Practices

1. Choose rich, descriptive tool names
2. Always provide capability descriptions
3. Specify tool usage requirements and constraints
4. Consider how tools work together in context
5. Test tool descriptions with edge cases
