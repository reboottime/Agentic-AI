# Giving Agents Tools

## Core Concept

Agentic systems interact with the world through **tools** or **actions**. Rather than allowing agents to "dream up" arbitrary solutions, we constrain them to specific capabilities that match real-world limitations - to solve a problem in a way that is bounded.

## Why Tools Matter

- Prevents unrealistic solutions (e.g., suggesting flying when flight isn't an option)
- Matches real-world resource constraints
- Enables controlled interaction with computer systems
- Bounds agent capabilities to what systems can actually perform

## Tool vs Action Terminology

**Tools** - Better for human interaction:

- Humans can flexibly adapt and perform multiple actions with one tool
- More open-ended capabilities

**Actions** - Better for computer systems:

- Computer systems have finite, rigid capabilities
- Easier to define explicit operations
- Similar to CPU instructions - limited set of defined operations

## Practical Example: Cooking Agent

### Tool Constraint Prompt

```md
These are the only tools available to you:
- One quart sauté pan
- Skillet  
- Large cast iron skillet
- Wood fire (burning oak)

You're going to help me cook whatever I need. Since you can't directly lift pots and pans or get food out, you will tell me the steps, and I will perform them. We will go one step at a time, ask me for what I want to cook.
```

### Interaction Flow

1. **Agent**: "What do you want to cook today?"
2. **Human**: "I want to cook pizza on the wood fire with a skillet or sauté pan"
3. **Agent**: "Fantastic choice, gather your ingredients"
4. **Human**: "I'm ready"
5. **Agent**: "Prepare the dough..." (provides specific steps)
6. Continue step-by-step using only available tools

## Key Principles

### Constraint-Based Problem Solving

- Agent must solve problems within defined tool boundaries
- Cannot request unavailable resources (e.g., microwave, Instant Pot)
- Forces creative solutions within limitations

### Real-World Application

- Computer systems have limited actions they can perform
- Systems are constrained and rigid
- Must express tool/action boundaries to the agent
- Essential for integration with CRM systems, email, databases

### Implementation Considerations

- Tools often described in computer-native languages for programmatic use
- Context determines whether to use "tool" or "action" terminology
- Must explicitly define each operation for rigid computer systems
- Human interfaces allow more flexible tool descriptions

## System Integration

When connecting agents to computer systems:

- Systems have very limited available actions
- Must express these limitations clearly to the agent
- Prevents agent from attempting impossible operations
- Ensures reliable system interaction
