# Try Out LLM Function Calling

When you run the second block in the notebook, the agent will prompt you for what action to take. You can say something like "tell me the files in the current directory" and it will make the appropriate tool choice. Experiment with the agent to see what it can and cannot do. 

Look for this beneath the code when you run the second block. Type in a task and hit enter. Remember, it only has tools for listing and reading files.
