# GAIL Framework - Goals, Actions, Information, Language

## Overview

GAIL is a mental framework for constructing effective AI agent prompts. Poor instructions lead to agent failure, just like giving terrible instructions to a new intern guarantees their failure.

## The GAIL Framework

### Goals (G) - Instructions & Behavior

- **Persona**: Define who the agent is ("You are action agent, a helpful AI assistant")
- **Purpose**: What you want the agent to accomplish ("Your goal is to accomplish the task given by the user")
- **Rules**: Things the agent can and cannot do
- **Process**: Step-by-step procedures to follow
  - Example: "First, check existing expenses → determine if already entered → ask user if they want to add anyway"

### Actions (A) - Available Tools

- Ways the agent can interact with computer systems or environment
- Tools and functions the agent can execute
- Listed in prompt as "The available tools are..."

### Information (I) - Context & Feedback

- **Initial Input**: Information provided at task start
- **Ephemeral Data**: Temporary, task-related information
- **Feedback**: Results from executed actions
- **Session State**: Accumulating information as actions are completed
- Information helps agent decide next action

### Language (L) - Communication Format

- How the agent should communicate back
- Output structure and format requirements
- Example format: "Always respond in the following format: Stop and think step-by-step..."

## Prompt Structure

### System Messages (G, A, L)

- Ground rules and persistent instructions
- Goals, available actions, and communication language
- Things the agent should always do

### User Messages (I)

- Information and feedback
- Inputs to the system
- Context for current task

## Example Agent Prompt Structure

```md
You are action agent, a helpful AI assistant. [PERSONA]
Your goal is to accomplish the task given by the user. [GOAL]
If you have enough information to directly respond to the user's request, you should do so. [PROCESS]
If you need to complete tasks, you can use the provided tools to help you. [PROCESS]
Whenever you're completely done with the task, you should tell the user the result and terminate the conversation. [PROCESS]
The available tools are... [ACTIONS]
Always respond in the following format... [LANGUAGE]
```

## Key Principle

Structure prompts using GAIL rather than adding random text until it works. This framework helps organize and think through what goes into effective agent instructions.
