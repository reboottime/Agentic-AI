# Domain Terms

- `Instrumentation`: Add logging and monitoring to tools to track their usage and performance. This provides valuable insights for improving both the tools and the agentâ€™s decision-making about when to use them.  I learned the term from [A Complete Example of Prompting for Structured Data](./module1/05.An_Invoice_Processing_Agent%20_Coursera.md)
- Tool `Discoverability`: Ensure tools have clear descriptions and tags so the agent can understand when to use them. Well-documented tool interfaces help both human developers and AI agents.  I learned the term from [A Complete Example of Prompting for Structured Data](./module1/05.An_Invoice_Processing_Agent%20_Coursera.md)
