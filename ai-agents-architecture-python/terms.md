# Domain Terms

- `Instrumentation`: Add logging and monitoring to tools to track their usage and performance. This provides valuable insights for improving both the tools and the agentâ€™s decision-making about when to use them.  I learned the term from [A Complete Example of Prompting for Structured Data](./module1/05.An_Invoice_Processing_Agent%20_Coursera.md)
- Tool `Discoverability`: Ensure tools have clear descriptions and tags so the agent can understand when to use them. Well-documented tool interfaces help both human developers and AI agents.  I learned the term from [A Complete Example of Prompting for Structured Data](./module1/05.An_Invoice_Processing_Agent%20_Coursera.md)
- metacognition: is an awareness of one's thought processes and an understanding of the patterns behind them. See [this wikipeadia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metacognition)
- cognitive framework: A cognitive framework includes implicit domain knowledge, methodologies understanding, contextual adaption and integrated value system. see at [The Persona Abstraction & Agents](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ai-agents-architecture-python/ungradedWidget/XvpTL/the-persona-abstraction-agents) article.
- preliminary questions: Preliminary questions are foundational questions asked at the start of a process to gather basic information, establish context, and guide the discussion or investigation. They help clarify the scope, identify potential issues, and ensure everyone is on the same page.
- [ ] [Heuristic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heuristic_(computer_science))
- computation:
  - the action of mathematical calculation. For example, "months of computation carried out on 200 computers"
  - the use of computers, especially as a subject of research or study.
