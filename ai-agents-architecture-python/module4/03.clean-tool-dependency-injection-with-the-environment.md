# Dependency Injection, the Environment, and the Decorator

Now that we have our ActionContext to hold shared resources and dependencies, we face a new challenge: how do we get it to just the tools that need it? We need a solution that provides dependencies selectively, giving each tool access to only the resources it requires.

Consider that many tools are simple and self-contained, needing only their explicit parameters. A basic string manipulation tool shouldn't receive memory access or authentication tokens it doesn't use. Not only would this add unnecessary complexity, but it could also create security concerns by exposing sensitive information to tools that don't need it.

For example, a simple text formatting tool needs nothing beyond its input text:

```python
@register_tool(description="Convert text to uppercase")
def to_uppercase(text: str) -> str:
    """Convert input text to uppercase."""
    return text.upper()
```

While a tool that interacts with external services needs authentication:

```python
@register_tool(description="Update user profile")
def update_profile(action_context: ActionContext,
                   username: str,
                   _auth_token: str) -> dict:
    """Update a user's profile information."""
    # This tool needs auth_token from context
    return make_authenticated_request(_auth_token, username)
```

The naive solution would be to modify our agent to pass the ActionContext to every tool. However, this would not only clutter our agent's orchestration logic with dependency management details but also force unnecessary dependencies on tools that don't need them. Every time the agent calls a tool, it would need to:

1. Check if the tool needs the ActionContext
2. Add it to the arguments if needed
3. Check for any other special dependencies the tool requires
4. Ensure these don't conflict with the actual parameters the tool expects

This quickly becomes messy. Here's what it might look like:

```python
def handle_agent_response(self, action_context: ActionContext,
                         response: str) -> dict:
    """Handle action with dependency injection in the agent."""
    action_def, action = self.get_action(response)
    
    # Agent has to manage all this dependency logic
    args = action["args"].copy()
    if needs_action_context(action_def):
        args["action_context"] = action_context
    if needs_auth_token(action_def):
        args["_auth_token"] = action_context.get("auth_token")
    if needs_user_config(action_def):
        args["_user_config"] = action_context.get("user_config")
    
    result = action_def.execute(**args)
    return result
```

This is exactly the kind of complexity we want to keep out of our agent. The agent should focus on deciding what actions to take, not on managing how dependencies get passed to tools. Additionally, this approach would make it harder to maintain security and separation of concerns, as every tool would potentially have access to all dependencies.

Instead, we can implement this logic in our environment system, which can examine each tool's requirements and provide only the dependencies it specifically requests. Consider how much cleaner the agent's code becomes:

```python
def handle_agent_response(self, action_context: ActionContext,
                         response: str) -> dict:
    """Handle action without dependency management."""
    action_def, action = self.get_action(response)
    result = self.environment.execute_action(self, action_context,
                                           action_def, action["args"])
    return result
```

The agent simply passes everything to the environment and lets it handle the details. The environment can then analyze each tool's signature and provide exactly the dependencies it needs - no more, no less.

## Updating the Environment to Provide Dependencies

Our environment system makes this possible. Let's walk through how it works.

First, we implement an environment that handles dependency injection:

```python
class PythonEnvironment(Environment):
    def execute_action(self, agent, action_context: ActionContext,
                      action: Action, args: dict) -> dict:
        """Execute an action with automatic dependency injection."""
        try:
            # Create a copy of args to avoid modifying the original
            args_copy = args.copy()
            
            # If the function wants action_context, provide it
            if has_named_parameter(action.function,
                                 "action_context"):
                args_copy["action_context"] = action_context
            
            # Inject properties from action_context that match
            # _prefixed parameters
            for key, value in action_context.properties.items():
                param_name = "_" + key
                if has_named_parameter(action.function, param_name):
                    args_copy[param_name] = value
            
            # Execute the function with injected dependencies
            result = action.execute(**args_copy)
            return self.format_result(result)
        except Exception as e:
            return {
                "tool_executed": False,
                "error": str(e)
            }
```

The environment examines each tool's function signature and automatically injects the dependencies it needs. This happens through two mechanisms:

1. Special parameter names like `action_context` are automatically injected
2. Properties from the action_context can be accessed by prefixing the parameter name with `_`

## Excluding Dependencies from the Tool Parameters Schema

Let's imagine a hypothetical tool for querying a database. The tool might want to access a database connection, configuration settings, and other dependencies like this:

```python
@register_tool()
def query_database(action_context: ActionContext,
                   query: str,
                   _db_connection: DatabaseConnection,
                   _config: dict) -> dict:
    """Process data using external dependencies."""
    # Tool automatically receives db_connection and config
    ... use the database connection ...
    return query_results
```

We want this tool to automatically receive the dependencies it needs, but we don't want the agent to have to understand or provide these parameters. The agent should only need to provide the 'query' parameter:

```python
# Agent only knows about and provides the data parameter
action = {
    "tool": "query_database",
    "args": {
        "query": "some SQL query"
    }
}
```

To hide the dependencies from the agent, we need to update our tool registration system to ignore these special parameters when building the schema that the agent uses:

```python
def get_tool_metadata(func, tool_name=None, description=None,
                     parameters_override=None, terminal=False,
                     tags=None):
    """Extract metadata while ignoring special parameters."""
    signature = inspect.signature(func)
    type_hints = get_type_hints(func)
    
    args_schema = {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {},
        "required": []
    }
    
    for param_name, param in signature.parameters.items():
        # Skip special parameters â€“ agent doesn't need to know about these
        if param_name in ["action_context", "action_agent"] or \
           param_name.startswith("_"):
            continue
        
        # Add regular parameters to the schema
        param_type = type_hints.get(param_name, str)
        args_schema["properties"][param_name] = {
            "type": "string"  # Simplified for example
        }
        
        if param.default == param.empty:
            args_schema["required"].append(param_name)
    
    return {
        "name": tool_name or func.__name__,
        "description": description or func.__doc__,
        "parameters": args_schema,
        "tags": tags or [],
        "terminal": terminal,
        "function": func
    }
```

Now we can create tools that use rich dependencies while keeping them hidden from the agent. For example, a tool that needs user authentication and configuration:

```python
@register_tool(description="Update user settings in the system")
def update_settings(action_context: ActionContext,
                   setting_name: str,
                   new_value: str,
                   _auth_token: str,
                   _user_config: dict) -> dict:
    """Update a user setting in the external system."""
    # Tool automatically receives auth_token and user_config
    headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {_auth_token}"}
    
    if setting_name not in _user_config["allowed_settings"]:
        raise ValueError(f"Setting {setting_name} not allowed")
    
    response = requests.post(
        "https://api.example.com/settings",
        headers=headers,
        json={"setting": setting_name, "value": new_value}
    )
    
    return {"updated": True, "setting": setting_name}
```

The agent only sees the `setting_name` and `new_value` parameters. When it calls the tool:

```python
# Agent's view of the tool
action = {
    "tool": "update_settings",
    "args": {
        "setting_name": "theme",
        "new_value": "dark"
    }
}
```

The environment automatically injects the `action_context`, `_auth_token`, and `_user_config` dependencies. This keeps our agent's orchestration logic clean while providing tools with the rich context they need to function.

This system gives us a clean separation of concerns:

- The agent focuses on deciding what actions to take
- Tools declare what dependencies they need
- The environment handles dependency injection and result management
- ActionContext provides a flexible container for shared resources
