# @register_tool Decorator

## What is @register_tool?

`@register_tool` is a **decorator** in Python that registers functions as tools in a larger system, likely an AI agent or workflow automation framework. It marks functions as available tools that can be dynamically discovered and executed by the system.

## How it Works

```python
@register_tool(tags=["document_processing", "invoices"])
def extract_invoice_data(action_context: ActionContext, document_text: str) -> dict:
    # Function implementation
```

The decorator:

- Takes parameters like `tags` for categorization
- Registers the decorated function in a tool registry
- Enables dynamic tool discovery and execution
- Allows metadata attachment (tags, descriptions)

## Programming Patterns

### 1. **Decorator Pattern**

- Modifies function behavior without changing the function itself
- Adds registration functionality transparently
- Common in frameworks for configuration and setup

### 2. **Registry Pattern**

- Maintains a central registry of available tools
- Enables dynamic discovery of capabilities
- Allows runtime tool selection based on requirements

### 3. **Plugin Architecture**

- Functions become pluggable components
- System can discover and load tools dynamically
- Supports extensibility and modularity

### 4. **Metadata-Driven Design**

- Tags provide semantic categorization
- Enables tool filtering and selection
- Supports automated documentation generation

## Usage Context

This pattern is commonly found in:

- **AI Agent Frameworks** (LangChain, AutoGen)
- **Workflow Systems** (Prefect, Apache Airflow)
- **Plugin Systems** (Flask extensions, Django apps)
- **Microservice Architectures** (service discovery)

The system likely uses these registered tools for automated task execution, where an AI agent can select appropriate tools based on context and requirements.
