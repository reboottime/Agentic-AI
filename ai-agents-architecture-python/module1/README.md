# Extending AI Agents with Self-Prompting

- [Prompts as computation](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ai-agents-architecture-python/lecture/9Nhwf/prompts-as-computation):

  - > Think about generative AI itself and prompts as a new form of computation. I want you to start thinking of prompts themselves as computation because when you start thinking of prompts as computation, that means you can start building tools for your agent that are based on prompts that you create.
 
  - Questions?:
    - [ ] Would we think about role first?
    - [ ] Would their role define the prompt then define the tools?
