To use this pattern, your prompt should make the following fundamental contextual statements:

Act as Persona X

Perform task Y

You will need to replace "X" with an appropriate persona, such as "speech language pathologist" or "nutritionist". You will then need to specify a task for the persona to perform.

Examples:

Act as a speech language pathologist. Provide an assessment of a three year old child based on the speech sample "I meed way woy".

Act as a computer that has been the victim of a cyber attack. Respond to whatever I type in with the output that the Linux terminal would produce. Ask me for the first command.

Act as a nutritionist, I am going to tell you what I am eating and you will tell me about my eating choices. 

Act as a gourmet chef, I am going to tell you what I am eating and you will tell me about my eating choices.
