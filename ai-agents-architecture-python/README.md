And this course doesn't discuss how Agent can learn from its experiences.

## Findings

- Even though the course marked it as a beginner level tutorial, I saw it captures industry trends and papers more closely than other courses I consulted.
- After learning the persona pattern, I'm less bothered by my own behavior and thinking patterns and others. If we live in a simulation, we might be conditioned by the personas assigned by our creator.
- How to find suitable course:
  - Follow course designers who can follow frontier and  present content well for the ordinary
  - Good learning system design
