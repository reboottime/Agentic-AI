# Agent Interaction & Memory

## Core Analogy: Boss & Intern Communication

Multiple coordination patterns exist between agents, similar to human workplace communication.

## Communication Pattern 1: Message Passing

### Basic Flow

```
Boss → Task Description → Intern → Work → Result → Boss
```

### Key Requirements

- **Rich task descriptions**: Quality of output depends on task description quality
- **Complete context**: Insufficient context leads to poor results
- **Clear specifications**: Agent must know how to write detailed task descriptions

### Challenge

First agent may not know what information the expert agent needs.

## Communication Pattern 2: Memory Handoff

### Problem with Message Passing

Coordinating agent may not know what context to provide to specialist agent.

### Solution: Full Context Transfer

```
Boss → Complete Log/Memory → Expert → Expert adds result → Updated Log
```

### Benefits

- Expert chooses relevant context
- No need for coordinator to know specialist requirements
- Rich information available for decision-making

### Implementation

- Hand off conversation memory to specialist agent
- Agent adds work to memory
- Returns updated memory with results

## Communication Pattern 3: Shared Memory

### Advanced Coordination

```
Boss ←→ Shared Memory ←→ Expert
```

### Full Memory Sharing

- Expert sees complete context
- Expert adds intermediate steps to memory
- Complete work stream maintained across agents
- Both agents can access and modify shared memory

## Trade-offs Analysis

### Message Passing

**Pros:**

- Clean separation of concerns
- Limited complexity for each agent
- Clear task boundaries

**Cons:**

- Requires perfect task descriptions
- May lack necessary context

### Memory Handoff

**Pros:**

- Rich context available
- Expert chooses relevant information
- No need for perfect task descriptions

**Cons:**

- Exposes agent to irrelevant information
- Increases complexity

### Shared Memory

**Pros:**

- Full context for all agents
- Transparent work processes
- Complete information sharing

**Cons:**

- High complexity exposure
- May overwhelm agents with irrelevant data
- Violates isolation principles

## Design Considerations

### Context vs Complexity

- More context = better decisions but higher complexity
- Less context = simpler processing but potential information gaps

### Information Relevance

- Scheduler agent may need full memory (participants, emails, time estimates)
- Boss agent may only need final result (meeting scheduled: yes/no)

### Memory Pollution

Avoid exposing agents to unnecessary intermediate steps that don't affect their reasoning.

## Key Principle

Choose communication pattern based on:

- Information requirements of each agent
- Complexity tolerance
- Need for context vs. simplicity
