# Providing Agent AI Information About the World

## Common Misconceptions

### Overestimating AI Knowledge

- People assume AI knows more than it actually does
- AI appears convincing but lacks specific contextual information
- General knowledge â‰  domain-specific knowledge

### Underestimating Context Requirements

- More context needed than typically provided
- AI lacks knowledge about your specific systems, culture, and preferences

## The Day-One Intern Analogy

### What Interns Don't Know

- Office layout and culture
- Company-specific systems
- Your personal preferences and history
- Your goals and priorities
- Domain-specific processes

### What AI Doesn't Know

- Your specific environment and tools
- Your preferences and constraints
- Current state of your systems
- Recent changes or updates
- Context-dependent nuances

## Real-World Examples

### Nintendo Wii TV Connection

**Problem**: Connect old Nintendo Wii (no HDMI) to modern TV

**Information Required**:

- Photo of TV's back panel showing available inputs
- Specific cable types and colors from Wii
- TV model and capabilities
- Physical constraints (wall-mounted)

**Key Insight**: "My TV" is insufficient without specific visual information and model details.

### Coffee Maker Usage

**Generic Request**: "Explain how to use this coffee maker"
**Specific Request**: Photo showing Keurig with model details

**Rich Information from Photo**:

- Brand identification (Keurig label)
- Physical design and button layout
- Available options and interfaces
- Current state of machine

## Information Requirements Framework

### Essential Context Categories

#### 1. System Information

- Specific models and versions
- Current configurations
- Available interfaces and options
- Physical constraints

#### 2. State Information

- Current status of systems
- Recent changes or updates
- Active processes or reservations
- Environmental conditions

#### 3. Goal Context

- Desired outcomes
- Constraints and preferences
- Timeline requirements
- Success criteria

## Dynamic Information Updates

### The Continuous Update Problem

AI needs ongoing state updates as conditions change.

### Example: Travel Reservations

**Scenario**: AI creates travel reservation while spouse independently books different dates

**Problem**: Without state updates, AI may create duplicate or conflicting reservations

**Solution**: Continuous information flow about:

- New bookings or changes
- External actions affecting plans
- System state modifications
- Environmental changes

## Best Practices

### Initial Context Setting

- Provide rich, specific information
- Include visual information when relevant
- Specify exact models, versions, configurations
- Document current state thoroughly

### Ongoing Updates

- Monitor for external changes
- Update AI when conditions change
- Verify assumptions periodically
- Maintain bidirectional information flow

### Information Completeness Check

Ask yourself:

- Does the AI have enough context to act like an expert intern?
- What domain knowledge am I assuming it has?
- What environmental factors could affect the outcome?
- How will I keep it informed of changes?

## Key Principle

**Treat AI like a highly capable but completely uninformed intern who needs comprehensive context about your specific situation, systems, and goals to perform effectively.**
