# Agent Interaction Patterns with Memory

## Memory Interaction Patterns in Multi-Agent Systems

When agents work together, how they share and manage memory dramatically affects their collaboration. Let's explore different patterns for memory interaction between agents, understanding when each pattern is most useful and how to implement it.

## Message Passing: The Basic Pattern

The simplest form of agent interaction is message passing, where one agent sends a request and receives a response. This is like sending an email to a colleague - they get your message, do some work, and send back their results. You don't see how they arrived at their answer; you just get their final response.

Here's how we implement basic message passing:

```python
@register_tool()
def call_agent(action_context: ActionContext,
               agent_name: str,
               task: str) -> dict:
    """Basic message passing between agents."""
    agent_registry = action_context.get_agent_registry()
    agent_run = agent_registry.get_agent(agent_name)
    
    # Create fresh memory for the invoked agent
    invoked_memory = Memory()
    
    # Run agent and get result
    result_memory = agent_run(
        user_input=task,
        memory=invoked_memory
    )
    
    # Return only the final memory item
    return {
        "result": result_memory.items[-1].get("content", "No result")
    }
```

This pattern works well when the first agent only needs the final answer, not the reasoning process. For example, if a project manager agent asks a scheduling agent to find a meeting time, it might only need to know when the meeting was scheduled, not how the time was chosen.

## Memory Reflection: Learning from the Process

Sometimes we want the first agent to understand how the second agent reached its conclusion. This is like asking a colleague to not just give you their answer, but to explain their thought process. We can achieve this by copying all of the second agent's memories back to the first agent:

```python
@register_tool()
def call_agent_with_reflection(action_context: ActionContext,
                               agent_name: str,
                               task: str) -> dict:
    """Call agent and receive their full thought process."""
    agent_registry = action_context.get_agent_registry()
    agent_run = agent_registry.get_agent(agent_name)
    
    # Create fresh memory for invoked agent
    invoked_memory = Memory()
    
    # Run agent
    result_memory = agent_run(
        user_input=task,
        memory=invoked_memory
    )
    
    # Get the caller's memory
    caller_memory = action_context.get_memory()
    
    # Add all memories from invoked agent to caller
    # although we could leave off the last memory to
    # avoid duplication
    for memory_item in result_memory.items:
        caller_memory.add_memory({
            "type": f"{agent_name}_thought",  # Mark source of memory
            "content": memory_item["content"]
        })
    
    return {
        "result": result_memory.items[-1].get("content", "No result"),
        "memories_added": len(result_memory.items)
    }
```

This pattern is valuable when the first agent needs to understand the reasoning process. For instance, if a research coordinator agent asks a data analysis agent to study some results, seeing the analysis process helps the coordinator better understand and use the conclusions.

## Memory Handoff: Continuing the Conversation

Sometimes we want the second agent to pick up where the first agent left off, with full context of what's happened so far. This is like having a colleague step in to take over a project - they need to know everything that's happened up to that point:

```python
@register_tool()
def hand_off_to_agent(action_context: ActionContext,
                      agent_name: str,
                      task: str) -> dict:
    """Transfer control to another agent with shared memory."""
    agent_registry = action_context.get_agent_registry()
    agent_run = agent_registry.get_agent(agent_name)
    
    # Get the current memory to hand off
    current_memory = action_context.get_memory()
    
    # Run agent with existing memory
    result_memory = agent_run(
        user_input=task,
        memory=current_memory  # Pass the existing memory
    )
    
    return {
        "result": result_memory.items[-1].get("content", "No result"),
        "memory_id": id(result_memory)
    }
```

This pattern is useful for complex tasks where context is crucial. For example, if a customer service agent hands off to a technical support agent, the technical agent needs to know the full history of the customer's issue.
