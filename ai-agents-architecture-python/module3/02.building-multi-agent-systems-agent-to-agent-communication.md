# Building Multi-Agent Systems: Agent-to-Agent Communication

## A call_agent Tool

Imagine we want to create a system where multiple specialized agents can work together, each bringing their unique capabilities to solve complex problems. For example, we might have a primary agent that coordinates high-level tasks but needs to delegate specialized work to other agents. To make this possible, we need a way for agents to communicate with each other.

As we have seen in the past, often the most effective way to add a capability to an agent is to expose it as a tool. This architectural approach makes it easy to create systems with multi-agent coordination by simply exposing the right tool interfaces between them. Let's build a multi-agent collaboration capability by creating a `call_agent` tool that allows one agent to invoke another and receive its results. We'll see how the ActionContext makes this surprisingly straightforward.

First, let's examine how the tool will work within an agent's execution:

```python
@register_tool()
def call_agent(action_context: ActionContext,
               agent_name: str,
               task: str) -> dict:
    """
    Invoke another agent to perform a specific task.
    
    Args:
        action_context: Contains registry of available agents
        agent_name: Name of the agent to call
        task: The task to ask the agent to perform
    
    Returns:
        The result from the invoked agent's final memory
    """
    # Get the agent registry from our context
    agent_registry = action_context.get_agent_registry()
    if not agent_registry:
        raise ValueError("No agent registry found in context")
    
    # Get the agent's run function from the registry
    agent_run = agent_registry.get_agent(agent_name)
    if not agent_run:
        raise ValueError(f"Agent '{agent_name}' not found in registry")
    
    # Create a new memory instance for the invoked agent
    invoked_memory = Memory()
    
    try:
        # Run the agent with the provided task
        result_memory = agent_run(
            user_input=task,
            memory=invoked_memory,
            # Pass through any needed context properties
            action_context_props={
                'auth_token': action_context.get('auth_token'),
                'user_config': action_context.get('user_config'),
                # Don't pass agent_registry to prevent infinite recursion
            }
        )
        
        # Get the last memory item as the result
        if result_memory.items:
            last_memory = result_memory.items[-1]
            return {
                "success": True,
                "agent": agent_name,
                "result": last_memory.get("content", "No result content")
            }
        else:
            return {
                "success": False,
                "error": "Agent failed to run."
            }
    except Exception as e:
        return {
            "success": False,
            "error": str(e)
        }
```

Let's examine how the `call_agent` tool enables inter-agent communication within our multi-agent system. This tool follows a careful protocol to ensure proper agent invocation while maintaining appropriate boundaries. When one agent needs to leverage the capabilities of another, it calls this function with the target agent's name and a description of the task to be performed. The function first retrieves the agent registry from the action context, which serves as a central directory of all available agents in the system. After confirming the requested agent exists, it creates a fresh memory instance for the agent being called, ensuring each invocation starts with a clean slate.

The core of this function lies in its actual invocation of the target agent. It calls the agent's run function with the provided task, passing along only the necessary context properties from the calling agent. Notice how it explicitly avoids passing the entire agent registry to prevent infinite recursion loops that could occur if agents continuously call each other without proper constraints. After the invoked agent completes its task, the function extracts the final memory item as the result, which represents the agent's ultimate conclusion or output. This structured approach to inter-agent communication ensures that agents can collaborate effectively while maintaining clear separation of concerns and avoiding potential pitfalls like circular references or excessive context sharing that could compromise the system's stability or security.

## Building a Meeting Scheduling System with Specialized Agents

Let's look at what a project management system where two agents work together to identify and schedule necessary meetings might look like. The project management agent decides when meetings are needed, while a scheduling specialist handles the logistics of actually arranging them.

First, let's look at the tools available to our scheduling specialist. This agent needs to interact with calendars and create invites:

```python
@register_tool()
def check_availability(
    action_context: ActionContext,
    attendees: List[str],
    start_date: str,
    end_date: str,
    duration_minutes: int,
    _calendar_api_key: str
) -> List[Dict]:
    """Find available time slots for all attendees."""
    return calendar_service.find_available_slots(...)

@register_tool()
def create_calendar_invite(
    action_context: ActionContext,
    title: str,
    description: str,
    start_time: str,
    duration_minutes: int,
    attendees: List[str],
    _calendar_api_key: str
) -> Dict:
    """Create and send a calendar invitation."""
    return calendar_service.create_event(...)
```

The scheduling specialist is focused entirely on finding times and creating meetings:

```python
scheduler_agent = Agent(
    goals=[
        Goal(
            name="schedule_meetings",
            description="""Schedule meetings efficiently by:
            1. Finding times that work for all attendees
            2. Creating and sending calendar invites
            3. Handling any scheduling conflicts"""
        )
    ],
    ...
)
```

Now let's look at our project management agent. This agent focuses on project status and deciding when meetings are needed:

```python
@register_tool()
def get_project_status(
    action_context: ActionContext,
    project_id: str,
    _project_api_token: str
) -> Dict:
    """Retrieve current project status information."""
    return project_service.get_status(...)

@register_tool()
def update_project_log(
    action_context: ActionContext,
    entry_type: str,
    description: str,
    _project_api_token: str
) -> Dict:
    """Record an update in the project log."""
    return project_service.log_update(...)

@register_tool()
def call_agent(
    action_context: ActionContext,
    agent_name: str,
    task: str
) -> Dict:
    """Delegate to a specialist agent."""
    # Implementation as shown in previous tutorial
```

The project management agent uses these tools to monitor progress and arrange meetings when needed:

```python
project_manager = Agent(
    goals=[
        Goal(
            name="project_oversight",
            description="""Manage project progress by:
            1. Getting the current project status
            2. Identifying when meetings are needed if there are
            issues in the project status log
            3. Delegating meeting scheduling to the
            "scheduler_agent" to arrange the meeting
            4. Recording project updates and decisions"""
        )
    ],
    ...
)
```

This division of responsibilities keeps each agent focused on its core competency:

- The project manager understands project status and when meetings are needed
- The scheduler excels at finding available times and managing calendar logistics
- The call_agent tool allows seamless collaboration between them

## The call_agent Tool

The `call_agent` tool manages several important aspects of agent interaction:

1. **Memory Isolation**: Each invoked agent gets its own memory instance, preventing confusion between different agents' conversation histories.

2. **Context Management**: We carefully control what context properties are passed to the invoked agent, preventing infinite recursion while ensuring necessary resources are available.

3. **Result Handling**: The tool extracts the final memory item as the result, providing a clean way to return information to the calling agent.

## Registering Agents

To make this system work, we need to register our agents in the registry:

```python
class AgentRegistry:
    def __init__(self):
        self.agents = {}
    
    def register_agent(self, name: str, run_function: callable):
        """Register an agent's run function."""
        self.agents[name] = run_function
    
    def get_agent(self, name: str) -> callable:
        """Get an agent's run function by name."""
        return self.agents.get(name)

# When setting up the system
registry = AgentRegistry()
registry.register_agent("scheduler_agent", scheduler_agent.run)

# Include registry in action context
action_context = ActionContext({
    'agent_registry': registry,
    # Other shared resources...
})
```

The ActionContext provides a clean way to make the agent registry available to the `call_agent` tool without exposing it directly to all tools. When an agent needs to delegate a task, it simply uses the tool like any other, and the environment system handles the details of finding and invoking the right agent.

This architecture allows us to build complex multi-agent systems where each agent maintains its specialization while being able to collaborate with other agents when needed. The memory isolation ensures that each agent works with a clean context, while the result extraction provides a standard way to pass information back to the calling agent.
