# Practical Application Example: Research Report Generation

Let me show you how this planning approach works with a concrete example - an AI agent tasked with creating a market research report.

## Traditional Ad Hoc Approach (Less Effective)

```md
User: "Create a market analysis report on electric vehicles in Europe"

LLM Response: *immediately starts searching*
- Searches "electric vehicles Europe"
- Writes some analysis
- Realizes needs sales data, searches again
- Writes more content
- Discovers missing regulatory info, searches again
- Produces inconsistent, scattered report
```

## Planning-Based Approach (More Effective)

### Step 1: Upfront Planning

```md
User: "Create a market analysis report on electric vehicles in Europe"

LLM Planning Phase:
1. Define report structure (market size, key players, regulations, trends)
2. Identify required data sources (industry reports, sales figures, policy docs)
3. Plan search strategy (start broad, then specific)
4. Outline analysis framework
5. Define deliverable format
```

### Step 2: Memory-Based Execution

**Plan stored in memory:**

```markdown
# EV Europe Research Plan
1. Market overview & size (2020-2024 data)
2. Key manufacturers analysis (Tesla, VW, BMW, etc.)
3. Regulatory landscape (EU Green Deal, country policies)
4. Consumer adoption trends
5. Infrastructure development
6. Future projections (2025-2030)
7. Synthesis & recommendations
```

**Execution with adaptation:**

```md
Action 1: Search "European electric vehicle market size 2024"
- Result: Found comprehensive data
- Status: ✅ Proceeding as planned

Action 2: Search "Tesla Volkswagen BMW electric vehicle sales Europe"
- Result: Data incomplete for BMW
- Adaptation: Add specific BMW search while maintaining plan structure

Action 3: Search "EU Green Deal electric vehicle regulations"
- Result: Found policy details
- Status: ✅ Proceeding as planned

[Continues through all planned sections with flexibility to adapt]
```

## Real Implementation Example

### Code-Based Planning (Fixed Execution)

```python
# LLM generates this research plan as executable code
def research_ev_market():
    # Step 1: Market data
    market_data = search_web("European EV market size 2024")
    
    # Step 2: Company analysis
    companies = ["Tesla", "Volkswagen", "BMW"]
    company_data = {}
    for company in companies:
        company_data[company] = search_web(f"{company} EV sales Europe 2024")
    
    # Step 3: Regulatory analysis
    regulations = search_web("EU electric vehicle regulations 2024")
    
    # Step 4: Generate report
    report = compile_report(market_data, company_data, regulations)
    return report

# Execute the plan
final_report = research_ev_market()
```

### Memory-Based Planning (Adaptive Execution)

```md
System Memory: [Research Plan stored]

User: "Create the report"

LLM: *References plan from memory*
"Following my research plan, I'll start with market overview..."
*Executes search_web("European EV market size 2024")*

*Analyzes results*
"The data shows unexpected growth in Nordic countries. I'll adapt my regional analysis section to include this insight while maintaining my planned structure."

*Continues execution with plan awareness*
```

## Benefits Demonstrated

**Fixed Planning**:

- Generated reusable research template
- Consistent methodology across similar reports
- Faster execution for repeated tasks

**Memory-Based Planning**:

- Maintained report structure despite data surprises
- Adapted to include unexpected Nordic market insights
- Balanced comprehensive coverage with emerging findings

## Model Optimization Example

- **Planning Phase**: Use GPT-4 (expensive, high-quality reasoning)
- **Execution Phase**: Use GPT-3.5 (cheaper, following the established plan)
- **Result**: Cost-effective while maintaining report quality

This approach transforms chaotic information gathering into systematic, thorough research that produces higher-quality, more comprehensive results.
