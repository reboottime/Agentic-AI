# Module 5: Approaches to Improving AI Agent Reasoning

## Progress

- [x] 01. Improving AI Agent Reasoning with In-Context Learning
  - what is it: show LLMs **correct examples** how to solve a task
  - rationale: 
    - LLMs are trained to predict the next word
    - The examples listed in the prompt show LLM a pattern it wants to follow
  - template: problem, thought, tool, result
  ```md
  1. Problem: feeling hungry. Thought: I need to prepare food. Tool: q63. Result: alien pizza prepared.
  2. Problem: need to move to other world. Thought: I need a wormhole. Tool: X155. Result: wormhole open to Vanderbilt University.
  ```
  - performance: it is increditably powerful for agents
- [ ] 02. Improving AI Agent Reasoning with Up-front Planning & Chain of Thought
- [ ] 03. The Capability Architectural Pattern
- [ ] 04. Ahead of Time Planning for Improving Agent Reasoning
- [ ] 05. Improving AI Agent Reasoning with In-loop Planning
