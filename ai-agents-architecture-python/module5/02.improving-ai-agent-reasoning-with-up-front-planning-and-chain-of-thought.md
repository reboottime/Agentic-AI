# Improving AI Agent Reasoning with Up-front Planning & Chain of Thought

## Key Concept

LLMs perform better when given time to think step-by-step and create a chain of thought. Having agents plan upfront before executing actions can significantly improve their reasoning capabilities.

## Why Chain of Thought Works

- When LLMs think step-by-step, they build upon correct logical steps
- If step one is correct, the next logical step is more likely to be correct
- Training data with step-by-step problem solving helps guide this process
- Ad hoc decision-making doesn't build the same complete chain of thought

## Up-front Planning Strategy

Instead of deciding actions on the fly, have the agent:

1. **Think about the plan first** - Build a complete plan of steps before executing
2. **Create step-by-step breakdown** - Detail what will be done at each stage
3. **Execute after planning** - Only start using tools and taking actions after the plan is complete

## Plan Execution Approaches

### 1. Fixed Code Execution

- **Process**: Agent creates plan → Manifests as code → Execute code without LLM involvement
- **Benefits**:
  - Repeatability - same code can be executed multiple times
  - Reusability - code can be saved and used in other projects
  - Speed - no LLM involved during execution
- **Limitations**: No adaptation if errors occur during execution

### 2. Memory-Based Planning

- **Process**: Agent creates plan → Store plan as memory → Execute step-by-step with plan awareness
- **Benefits**:
  - Maintains chain of thought reasoning
  - Allows adaptation during execution
  - Agent can see results of individual steps
  - Can adjust if unexpected situations arise
- **Use case**: When flexibility and adaptation are needed

## Model Optimization Strategy

- Use **higher-quality, expensive model** for initial planning phase
- Use **lower-quality, faster model** for plan execution
- Separate planning as a tool that must be called at the start
- This approach balances quality reasoning with execution efficiency

## Implementation Pattern

1. Force agent to use planning tool at start of every execution
2. Generate comprehensive plan using best available model
3. Store plan in agent memory
4. Execute plan step-by-step with ability to adapt
5. Maintain awareness of original plan throughout execution

## Benefits Summary

- **Improved reasoning** through structured thinking
- **Better problem-solving** via step-by-step approach
- **Cost optimization** by using expensive models only for planning
- **Flexibility** to adapt while maintaining strategic direction
- **Repeatability** when plans can be codified and reused
