## Insights

[The principles in playing chess](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ai-agents-architecture-python/ungradedWidget/65nG7/mate-design-principles-in-code). Gus in breaking bad applies these principles really well.

> In chess, a checkmate represents the perfect execution of strategy - every piece positioned correctly, every move calculated for maximum effect, leading to an inevitable victory. When building AI agents, we can apply similar strategic thinking through the MATE principles: Model efficiency, Action specificity, Token efficiency, and Environmental safety.
