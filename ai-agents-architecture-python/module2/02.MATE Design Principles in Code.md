# MATE Design Principles in Code

## The MATE Design Principles

In chess, a checkmate represents the perfect execution of strategy - every piece positioned correctly, every move calculated for maximum effect, leading to an inevitable victory. When building AI agents, we can apply similar strategic thinking through the MATE principles: Model efficiency, Action specificity, Token efficiency, and Environmental safety.

## Model Efficiency: Choose Your Pieces Wisely

In chess, each piece has unique capabilities. You wouldn’t use a queen when a pawn would suffice. Similarly, model efficiency means selecting the right LLM for each task:

```python
@register_tool(description="Extract basic contact information from text")
def extract_contact_info(action_context: ActionContext, text: str) -> dict:
    """Extract name, email, and phone from text using a smaller, faster model."""
    # Use a smaller model for simple extraction
    response = action_context.get("fast_llm")(Prompt(messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "Extract contact information in JSON format."},
        {"role": "user", "content": text}
    ]))
    return json.loads(response)
```

```python
@register_tool(description="Analyze complex technical documentation")
def analyze_technical_doc(action_context: ActionContext, document: str) -> dict:
    """Perform deep analysis of technical documentation."""
    # Use a more capable model for complex analysis
    response = action_context.get("powerful_llm")(Prompt(messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "Analyze technical this documentation thoroughly to identify potential contradictions in process that could lead to unexpected problems."},
        {"role": "user", "content": document}
    ]))
    return json.loads(response)
```
Action Specificity: Control the Board
In chess, precise positioning limits your opponent’s options. Similarly, specific actions limit the potential for misuse or confusion:

```python
# Too generic - opens up possibilities for misuse

@register_tool(description="Modify calendar events")
def update_calendar(action_context: ActionContext,
                   event_id: str,
                   updates: dict) -> dict:
    """Update any aspect of a calendar event."""
    return calendar.update_event(event_id, updates)
```

```python
# More specific - clear purpose and limited scope

@register_tool(description="Reschedule a meeting you own to a new time")
def reschedule_my_meeting(action_context: ActionContext,
                         event_id: str,
                         new_start_time: str,
                         new_duration_minutes: int) -> dict:
    """
    Reschedule a meeting you own to a new time.
    Only works for meetings where you are the organizer.
    """
    # Verify ownership
    event = calendar.get_event(event_id)
    if event.organizer != action_context.get("user_email"):
        raise ValueError("Can only reschedule meetings you organize")

    # Validate new time is in the future
    new_start = datetime.fromisoformat(new_start_time)
    if new_start < datetime.now():
        raise ValueError("Cannot schedule meetings in the past")
        
    return calendar.update_event_time(
        event_id,
        new_start_time=new_start_time,
        duration_minutes=new_duration_minutes
    )
```
Token Efficiency: Maximize Every Move
In chess, every move should advance your position. Let’s imagine that we need to analyze some sales data and all we need is the YoY growth and top 3 trends. If we prompt for more than we need or provide unnecessary context, we’re wasting tokens. Sometimes, we might need to add more tokens to get the appropriate level of reasoning, but we should test and optimize for the most efficient use of tokens. A longer prompt will consume more input tokens and if we assign the LLM more to do than we need, we also will end up with wasted output tokens:

```python
# Token inefficient - includes unnecessary context

@register_tool(description="Analyze sales data to identify trends and patterns...")
def analyze_sales(action_context: ActionContext, data: str) -> str:
    """
    This function will analyze sales data to identify trends and patterns.
    It looks at various aspects including:
    - Monthly trends
    - Seasonal patterns
    - Year-over-year growth
    - Product category performance
    - Regional variations
    - Customer segments

    The analysis will be thorough and consider multiple factors...
    [More verbose documentation]
    """
    
    # This prompt asks for unneeded analysis, leading to both a waste of input and output tokens
    return prompt_llm(action_context, f"""
        Analyze this sales data thoroughly. Consider monthly trends,
        seasonal patterns, year-over-year growth, product categories,
        regional variations, and customer segments. Provide detailed
        insights about all these aspects.
        
        Data: {data}
        
        Please give a comprehensive analysis...
    """)
```

```python
# Token efficient - focused and precise

@register_tool(description="Analyze sales data for key trends")
def analyze_sales(action_context: ActionContext, data: str) -> str:
    """Calculate key sales metrics and identify significant trends."""

    # This prompt is focused and precise, using tokens efficiently
    return prompt_llm(action_context, f"""
        Sales Data: {data}

        3. Flag significant anomalies
